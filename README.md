# Game-Master
A work in progress social network/web application for boardgame and pnp rpg players.

I want to create a social and community platform for board game and pen and paper RPG players. This is an idea I've been thinking about for a
while now, seeing as me and my friends often find our selves in the
situation where we're missing a few players for a certain game. I also, often
hear people talking about wanting to try DnD or Pathfinder, but not
knowing anyone who plays it. This would streamline the process of
finding players or players finding parties.

Some of the features included would be:

    party finder/player finder - this would connect the people looking to play based on game preferences and location whether IRL or online
    game recommendations - determined by player preference this would recommend similar games to the ones the player already plays or would like to play
    friends and parties - similar to how groups work on other social media this would create a constant list of people you played with or added as friends
    game map - determined by the game chosen and current location shows nearby games looking for players
    forums - a simple forum for people to discuss their experiences with games or people
    player rating - determined by the number of games played and liking or disliking by other players
    game store - this would contain free material for some games and links to where to buy other games and expansions
    game database - users can add games on their own which would of course be moderated before being added to the game library this would require a lot of work to 
    properly find and add as many board and p&p games as possible
